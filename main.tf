 * Description of the Terraform Module
 *
 * ## Using this as Git Template
 * 
 * **IMPORTANT!!!**
 *
 * IF you are using this repo as a template to create a new one, for a Terraform module, there are some changes to apply before proceeding to commit on the new Repo:
 *  
 * 1. Delete completely the `CHANGELOG.md` file, to avoid wrong versions or description.
 * 2. Update the file `package.json` with the correct info about the starting version, or author or anything else.
 *
 * ## Actions
 * 
 * ### On Pull Requests
 * 
 * When a `Pull Request` is opened or updated, an action to create or update the module's README is triggered.
 * 
 * Upon termination the action pushes the updated code the the same `Pull Request`, with a commed that doesn't trigger a new one.
 *
 * After the git push is done the code markdown linting is checked to check the syntax correctness.
 *
 * ### On Push
 * 
 * When a `Push` is made to the `main` branch, an action to create a `tag`, a `release` and a `changelog` udpate is triggered.
 *
